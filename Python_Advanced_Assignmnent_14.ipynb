Is an assignment operator like += only for show? Is it possible that it would lead to faster results at the runtime ?**\n","\n","Ans: A=A+1 evaluates to finding A, adding 1 to it. Then storing the value again in variable A. This expression makes Python to look for memory holder of a twice. But A+=1 simply means value of A is to incremented by 1. As memory address has to be identified once, += leads to faster operation."],"metadata":{"id":"78VB4Riv95qe"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Q2.
